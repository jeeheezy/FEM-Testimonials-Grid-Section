## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was my first time setting the font-size at root level and seeing how the scaling is different when using rem. It was also my first time using grid-area instead of grid-column and grid-rows as separate properties. I'm often included to think of the columns first when working with grids, so I need to be mindful when using grid-area that it starts with grid-row first. 


### Continued development

While I'm becoming more comfortable with grid, it does sometimes behave in ways I do not expect, so I'd like to continue getting familiar with the tool. Additionally, I found I had to specify padding and margins on a lot of individual elements to get the result close to what was desired, so I'd like to learn how I can avoid that clutter.
